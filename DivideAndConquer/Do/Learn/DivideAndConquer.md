# Divide and Conquer

## Basic Explanation
Picture a train in your head with a mile long set of attached box cars. Your job is to inspect each car to make sure they are safe to continue traveling. It would probably take you a long time. Now what if you had someone start at the end while you started at the beggining? It would be much quicker wouldn't it? If there is damage it could be found in half the time and if theres no damage all the cars will be inspected in half the time.
